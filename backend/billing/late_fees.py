Late-fee accrual (Phase C).

A scheduled task scans StudentFee rows that are past due_date + grace_days,
have a non-zero outstanding balance, and haven't had a late fee applied
yet. The fee is added to amount_due, status flips to 'overdue', and we
record the surcharge amount + timestamp on the row so the task is
idempotent.
