"""
SM-2 Spaced Repetition Algorithm Service.

Based on the SuperMemo SM-2 algorithm:
https://www.supermemo.com/en/blog/application-of-a-computer-to-improve-the-results-obtained-in-working-with-the-supermemo-method

Quality ratings (0-5):
  5 — Perfect recall, no hesitation
  4 — Correct after minor hesitation
  3 — Correct with serious difficulty
  2 — Incorrect, but remembered once shown
  1 — Incorrect, close to remembering
  0 — Complete blackout

Quality >= 3 → node is "passed" → progress the interval
Quality < 3  → node is "failed" → reset, review again tomorrow
