# SDLC Workflow Playbook
## SaaS Delivery System for E-Learning WebApp

**Purpose:** Provide a professional, repeatable, stepwise workflow from idea to production scale for this LMS/ERP SaaS.

This folder is the execution guide for product, design, engineering, QA, and operations.

## Lifecycle Overview
| Phase | Name | Primary Owners | Key Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| 01 | Discovery and Problem Definition | Product, Founders | PRD, personas, KPIs |
| 02 | MVP Scope and Roadmap | Product, Engineering | MVP scope, milestones, risk register |
| 03 | System Architecture and Tech Decisions | Engineering Leadership | Architecture diagram, ADRs |
| 04 | UX/UI Design | Product Design | Wireframes, prototype, design rules |
| 05 | Data Model and API Contract | Backend, Platform | ERD, API contract, storage strategy |
| 06 | DevOps Baseline | Platform Engineering | CI/CD baseline, environments, secrets model |
| 07 | Agile Implementation | Engineering | Sprint increments |
| 08 | Testing and Quality | QA + Engineering | Automated suites and coverage targets |
| 09 | Security and Compliance Hardening | Security + Platform | Security checklist, incident response plan |
| 10 | Beta Launch (Pilot Schools) | Product + Customer Success | Pilot validation report |
| 11 | Production Launch | Product + Engineering + Support | Launch runbook, support workflow, DR readiness |

## How to Use This Workflow
1. Start each new product initiative by cloning the templates from `templates/`.
2. Complete each phase document in order and attach evidence links.
3. Do not move to next phase unless exit criteria are met.
4. Track gaps in sprint backlog and risk register.
5. Review this playbook every quarter and update process improvements.

## Stage Gate Policy
- `Gate A` (after Phase 02): MVP scope signed off.
- `Gate B` (after Phase 05): Design + data + API contracts frozen for sprint execution.
- `Gate C` (after Phase 09): Security hardening complete for beta.
- `Gate D` (after Phase 11): Launch readiness approved.
